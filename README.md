PriceCraft for WooCommerce is a WordPress plugin that enhances the WooCommerce platform with advanced price management features, including category-based pricing and product weight customization.

## Features

### Category-Based Pricing
PriceCraft allows you to set base prices for products within specific categories. This feature enables you to implement more flexible pricing strategies tailored to different product categories.

### Product Weight Customization
With PriceCraft, you can customize the weight of your products. This customization is essential for accurately calculating shipping costs and adjusting product pricing based on weight.

   - Navigate to Plugins > Add New.
   - Click on the "Upload Plugin" button and select the ZIP file you downloaded.

3. **Install and Activate**:

## Usage

1. **Product Weight and Making Charge**:
   - After installing and activating the plugin, navigate to the WooCommerce product editor.
   - In the product editor, you'll find new fields for "Product Weight" and "Making Charge" under the "General" tab. Enter the weight and making charge for each product.

2. **Category-Based Pricing**:
